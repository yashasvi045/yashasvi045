Hey there, I’m @yashasvi045!

I’m interested in learning to code and hone my skills. I’m currently learning Python on a beginner level.
I’m looking to collaborate on projects, app development, video game development... and much more, when the time comes.

How to reach me: idk, will update soon!
Pronouns: he/him
Fun fact: i also like to play/write & produce music in my free time!
